## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an application which manages an inventory of products. The end user will be consumer goods 
companies that need to keep track of the products they have in inventory and forecast future demand. The application will enable the user 
to view the products they have in their inventory, add new products to their inventory, mark items as discontinued, calculate their 
inventory value, track and view their sales history, and generate a demand forecast.

This project was inspired by my past experience with managing a company's inventory and creating forecasts to determine how much inventory
should be ordered.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.

View inventory items: Users will be able to view all items in their inventory. Users can only see their inventory. They will be able to 
see the item info (number, description, status) as well as the sales history of the item. 

Create new inventory item: Users will be able to create new inventory items.

Add sales to an inventory item: Users will be able to add sales from the previous month(s) to an inventory item.

Forecast demand: Users will be able to forecast demand for their inventory based on current inventory levels, safety stock, and past sales 
history. Stretch goals: add in lead times and future orders to forecasting.
### Technologies
C#
ASP.net Core MVC
ASP.net Razor
Entity Framework Core
LINQ
HTML
GitHub
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to take the forecasting knowledge I have and translate it so that it can be built into my application. I will
also need to learn how to implement user signups in C#.
